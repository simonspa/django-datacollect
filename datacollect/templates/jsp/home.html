    <p>providing a comprehensive overview of UN action on behalf of individual human rights defenders at risk in the 21st century.</p>

    <p>"Human rights defenders" is a term that has been introduced into international human rights advocacy primarily by the so-called "Declaration on human rights defenders" , adopted in 1998 by the UN General Assembly (its very handy original title is Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms). It took about 12 years of controversial negotiation to get to that point, in which many NGOs that were already working with and on HRD played a crucial role. The underlying rationale of developing such a declaration was the recognition that the implementation of international human rights standards within countries depends to a great extent on the contribution of individuals and groups working inside and outside the respective state, and that HRD become the last line of defense when states fail to provide protection against human rights violations. The acknowledgment of the fact that HRD are often the target of violations themselves, precisely because of their human rights work, led to the formal establishment of human rights "defense" as a right in itself and the recognition of those defenders as "human rights defenders".</p>

    <p>You might ask yourself – so, what is the exact definition of this term? Who is meant by it? Well, there is no clear definition. The one given by the Declaration and in later documents is very broad: HRD are people who advocate universal human rights through their work or activism and with peaceful means. Basically everyone can potentially be a HRD. This also means that every NGO and UN mandate-holder has a slightly different understanding of the term.</p>

    <p>Ever since the Declaration, there have been attacks by repressive states against both the concept and defenders themselves, of course. The Russian Federation, for instance, tried in the last Council session to get the – by now well established – term "human rights defender" entirely deleted from the newest resolution on the subject – and replace it with the handy original title of the Declaration instead. Furthermore, in an action without precedent, a group of states under the leadership of Russia managed to delay the formal adoption by the General Assembly (GA) of an already adopted HRC resolution. This resolution 24/24 was designed to enhance protection mechanisms within the UN for people who cooperate with UN human rights bodies and face reprisals for it in their home country. Ultimately, the resolution was dropped from the GA’s agenda last year without being adopted and the envisaged focal point was never established. This is very important in order to understand the stance of human rights defenders within the UN and the kind of pressure they are working under.</p>
